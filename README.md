# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub.

I never liked the prompt "write about yourself". I always find it hard to come out with a brief, spontaneous, biography of myself. I guess people expect me to write about the things I like, the places I've lived and about the hopes and dreams I have for the following weeks. If that's the case, I like pizza, I've lived in Mexico for most of my life and I hope and dream to do a good job in this program for the following weeks, make the most of it, enjoy it, and make me proud of myself, once again.
